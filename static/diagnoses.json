There is near total opacification of the left\r\nmaxillary sinus and both ethmoid sinuses from a combination of\r\nblood and mucous. Lobulated mucosal thickening in addition to\r\nfluid is present within the right maxillary sinus as well. The\r\nlamina propecia appear intact, there is mild mucosal thickening\r\nof the frontal sinuses. The patient is intubated, and an NG tube\r\nis present.\r\n\r\nIMPRESSION: Multiple facial fractures including both maxillary\r\nsinuses and right zygoma, and left nasal bone, as well is a\r\nnondisplaced fracture from the lateral inferior orbital rim\r\nextending posteriorly into the left orbital floor without\r\nevidence for fat herniation or orbital abnormality.\r\n\r\nCHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2200-7-16**] 9:55 AM\r\n\r\nCHEST (PORTABLE AP)\r\n\r\nReason: STAT X RAY RESP DISTRESS\r\n\r\n[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:\r\n60 year old man s/p fall, wbc elevation, s/p intubation\r\nREASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:\r\nSTAT X RAY RESP DISTRESS\r\nCHEST ONE VIEW PORTABLE\r\n\r\nINDICATION: 60-year-old man status post fall.\r\n\r\nCOMMENTS: Portable erect AP radiograph of the chest is reviewed,\r\nand compared with the previous study of yesterday.\r\n\r\nThe previously identified mild congestive heart failure has been\r\nimproving. There is also gradual improvement of the multifocal\r\npneumonia, possibly due to aspiration. The heart is normal in\r\nsize. There is continued tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. No\r\nevidence for pneumothorax is identified.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrief Hospital Course:\r\nPatient admitted to the trauma service. Neurosurgery was\r\nconsulted because of his head bleed. Serial head CT scans were\r\nfollowed and were stable; an MRI of the brain also revealed\r\nDiffuse Axonal Injury ([**Doctor First Name **]). He was started on Dilantin which\r\nwill need to continue until follow up with Neurosurgery. His\r\nDilantin dose has been adjusted several times because of\r\nsubtherapeutic levels; these levels will need to rechecked in\r\nthe next several days. Plastics was consulted as well because of\r\nhis facial fractures; these were non operative.\r\n\r\nBehavioral Neurology was consulted because of the behavioral\r\nissues associated with his head injury; he was started on\r\nOlanzapine standing dose; a prn dose was added for episodes of\r\nincreased agitation. Trazodone was also added to help regulate\r\nhis sleep/wake cycle. He initially required 1:1 sitters because\r\nof his increased agitation; these have been discontinued. His\r\nmental status has improved, although there are still problems\r\nwith decreased short term memory; there have been no further\r\nepisodes of agitation.\r\n\r\nHe had episodes of loose stool during his hospital stay; a stool\r\nfor C-Diff was obtained and was negative. His WBC was also\r\nelevated; thought to be related to a small aspiration pneumonia\r\nnoted on chest radiograph. His white count has trended downward\r\nover the past several days.\r\n\r\nSpeech and Swallow were consulted to evaluate for dysphagia\r\ngiven his head injury and altered mental status; initially he\r\ndid not pass the bedside evaluation. As his mental status\r\nimproved his diet was upgraded to regular with thin liquids.\r\n\r\nPhysical and Occupational therapy were consulted and have\r\nrecommended rehab for improving function and cognitive\r\nabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nMedications on Admission:\r\nNeurontin\r\nNortriptyline\r\nAlbuterol MDI\r\nLisinopril\r\nLorazepam\r\n\r\nDischarge Medications:\r\n1.

An echo demonstrated new\r\nanterior lateral hypokinesis, compared to previous studies,\r\noverall LV systolic function was decreased (LVEF 45%) and\r\ndemonstrated new wall motion abnormalities.
